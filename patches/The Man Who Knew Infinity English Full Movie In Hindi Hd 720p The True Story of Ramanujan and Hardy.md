## Plot Summary
 
The film begins in 1913, when Ramanujan (Dev Patel), a self-taught mathematical prodigy, works as a clerk at the Madras Port Trust. He writes down his original and complex mathematical formulas in notebooks, but has no formal education or recognition. He sends a letter to G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons), a prominent mathematician at Cambridge University, enclosing some of his theorems. Hardy is intrigued by Ramanujan's work and invites him to come to England and work with him.
  
Ramanujan arrives in Cambridge in 1914, leaving behind his wife Janaki (Devika Bhise) and his mother (Arundhati Nag) in India. He faces many challenges in adapting to the British academic culture and the racism and prejudice of some of his colleagues. He also suffers from poor health and homesickness. However, he finds a friend and supporter in Hardy, who recognizes his genius and helps him publish his papers in prestigious journals. Ramanujan also develops a close bond with another mathematician, John Littlewood (Toby Jones), and impresses other eminent scholars such as Bertrand Russell (Jeremy Northam) and Alfred North Whitehead (Anthony Calf).
  
The film depicts some of the most significant mathematical discoveries and collaborations of Ramanujan and Hardy, such as the Hardy-Ramanujan number, the partition function, the Riemann series, and the mock theta functions. It also shows how Ramanujan's faith and intuition influenced his work, often clashing with Hardy's rationalism and skepticism. The film ends with Ramanujan returning to India in 1919, after being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He dies shortly afterwards at the age of 32, leaving behind a legacy of brilliant and original mathematics.
